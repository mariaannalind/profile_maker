# profile_maker

A learning project. For now it has no real function other than trying out Flutter widgets, navigation and other features.

## TODO
- ~~implement handling app state with provider/consumer pattern~~
- ~~reset state~~
- ~~prefil with current state~~
- mark radio buttons as chosen
- styling
- refactor conditional rendering of widgets
- refactor navigation so as not to replace appBar and bottomNavigationBar 
  - can this effect be achieved by animation/transition only?
  - is it a question of better layouting
